### Introduction

__Expanse__ is a program for virtualizing your desktop windows in a 3-D, immersive environment. A program on the host computer grabs window screens from your computer, starts a server and allows you to access a 3-d scene with your windows rendered by Three.JS. We currently use the Google Cardboard & a phone as the HMD.
