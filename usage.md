# Usage

_You need to make sure your Kinect is plugged in and the proper drivers are installed. If not, please install the necessary drivers. Check __installation.md__ for more info_

## How to use Expanse

Follow these steps:

1. Install the Kinect drivers and make sure it works properly. Follow the installation instructions in **installation.md**

2. Go into the folder where you unzipped Expanse, and run **expanse.bat**.

    This will start the four major components of the system - the window capture, gesture tracking, and server systems.
    
3. To quit the program, go to the menu icon (TODO: insert picture of icon) and right-click it. Select _'Quit'_ from the menu that appears, and Expanse will close.
